  <h2> Exercise 5: <em>Creating a Webpage</em> </h2>
<h3> (Required for Week 8 Assessment) </h3>

The professional skills assignment for this week is to use your GitHub account to create a webpage.  During the Week 8 Assessment, you will need to direct us to this webpage by providing its URL (it should end in <code>github.io</code>). You will be assessed on the contents of that webpage.

To create your page, you should follow the instructions on the <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages site</a>.  This will guide you through the process of creating an appropriately named repository to set up your page.  Once you have completed this, you should add to this repository a file named <code>index.html</code> containing the following text:

<pre>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;

 &lt;head&gt;
 &lt;title&gt;MTH4000 exercise&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

 &lt;body&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;

&lt;/html&gt;</pre>

You will be marked on:

<ul>
    <li>having a webpage;</li>
    <li>using the above <code>index.html</code>;</li>
    <li>entering some text into the body of that webpage (i.e. between <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code>), taking care that nothing else in <code>index.html</code>  is altered</li>

<br>
<b>Note:</b> While you are welcome to later use this webpage for your own use, you should exercise care and only provide information that you are comfortable with. For purpose of the assessment it is not necessary to put any personal information onto that page.
